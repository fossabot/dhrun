`dhrun`
=======

This is a Dhall/YAML configurable job executor meant to be used for pass/fail
CI tests. It starts a list of processes, monitors the standard streams for
patterns that should be expected or avoided, kills the processes when those
criteria are met and exits accordingly.

### Use

You can resolve imports, normalize, and run a dhall configuration on the fly with:

```{.bash}
dhrun run path/to/config.dhall 
```

You may also use a plain YAML file:
```{.bash}
dhrun run path/to/config.yaml
```

See the [examples](./examples/) directory for example `.yml` and `.dh` configurations.
The [resources](./resources) directory contains the Dhall types for the configuration
layer. It also serves as reference documentation, but here's a yaml example to serve as a quickstart:

```{.yaml}
verbose: null # whether to be verbose.
cleaning: null # whether to remove the global workdir on startup.
workdir: /tmp/dhrun # the global working directory (with creation) - defaults to "./"
pre: # a list of shell commands to run before the asynchronous step.
  - pwd # will print /tmp/dhrun
cmds: # a list of commands with the following structure:
- otherwd: null # an alternate working directory for this command
  name: echo # command name 
  args: # arguments
    - hello
    - world
  # a "filecheck" on out: terminates dhrun successfully as soon as all 'wants'
  # are observed on *at least one* command, and exits dhrun with an error as soon 
  # as one "avoid" is observed. These specifications are substrings to be matched.
  out:
    filecheck:
      wants: 
       - hello
       - world
      avoids: null
    filename: foo
  err: # a "filecheck" on stderr
    filecheck:
      wants: null
      avoids:
       - Traceback
    filename: bar
  postchecks: null # a list of "filechecks" to be performed post-execution
  passvars: null # environment variables to inherit (famously, PATH.)
  vars: # environment variables to enforce 
  - value: BAR
    varname: FOO
  timeout: 4 # timeout in seconds
post: # a list of shell commands to run after the asynchronous step.
```

Useful command-line options are the following.

- `dhrun print` prints the result of a dhall config to stdout
- The `"-"` file input argument forces the binary to use the standard input
  (assuming the YAML format).
- The `-e` option allows to edit the configuration (in YAML) on the fly before
  execution

A workflow to evaluate the config via a dhall codebase at configuration time
might involve `dhall` and `dhall-to-yaml`:

```{.bash}
dhall resolve <<< "let codebase = /path/package.dhall in codebase.foo bar baz" |\
dhall normalize |\
dhall-to-yaml |\
dhrun run "-" 
```

### Installation

There is a small vendored Nix codebase in /nix.

```
nix-env -f . -iA dhrun
```

The `/nix` folder is mostly there to manage the development workflow so feel
free to try other ways. The hackage dependencies for `dhrun` and its tests are:

```{.unwrap pipe="runhaskell | pandoc -t json"}
{-# language OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# language NoImplicitPrelude #-}
import Protolude
import Distribution.PackageDescription.Parsec
import Distribution.PackageDescription
import Distribution.PackageDescription.Configuration
import Distribution.Verbosity
import Distribution.Types.Dependency
import Distribution.Types.PackageName
import Data.Text as T (pack)
main = do
  pdesc <- readGenericPackageDescription
             normal
             "root/dhrun.cabal"
  let depnames =
       map (unPackageName . depPkgName) $
       allBuildDepends $
       flattenPackageDescription pdesc
  for_ depnames $ \x -> putText $ "`" <> toS x <> "`"
```

### Hacking

- `nix-shell` provides a dev environment with cabal-build, ghcid, hlint,
  brittany, and others. There is a small vendored codebase in /nix that
  provides this via nixpkgs pinning.  

- you need to procure
  [`dhall-to-cabal`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-to-cabal) separately
  because I didn't see fit to add that package as of the shell environment.
  It's necessary if you want to edit the cabal file, which is done through
  [`./cabal.dh`](./cabal.dh).

- edit `.README.md` instead of `README.md` and run `./shake readme`. `./shake`
  also has other useful dev workflows.

- `direnv allow` for [lorri](https://github.com/target/lorri) integration.

The structure of the code is the following.

- `/resources` Dhall types and helper functions.

- `/app` the main cli tool.

- `/examples`s example Dhall and YAML configuration files for dhrun. These
  also serve as golden tests.

- `/src` dhrun types and logic.

- `/tests` golden, unit, quickcheck tests.

### CLI Help

```{.hidden pipe="bash"}
echo "dhrun --help"
cd root
cabal build > /dev/null
```

```{.txt pipe="sh"}
root/dist/build/dhrun/dhrun --help
```
