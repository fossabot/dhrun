##### `dhrun`: [Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/)/[YAML](https://yaml.org/) configurable concurrent process executor with streaming assertions. 

`dhrun` starts a list of (Unix) processes, monitors the standard streams for
patterns that should be expected or avoided, kills the processes when criteria
are met and exits accordingly. It is configured either using
[Dhall](https://dhall-lang.org/) or [YAML](https://yaml.org/). Its goals are
similar to [venom](https://github.com/ovh/venom). Compared to that tool,
`dhrun` has only one execution capability(exec) and its assertions are
poor(infix strings only).  It supports concurrency and monitors streams,
however. It was written to create a configuration layer to control single-node
integration tests for a linux daemon.

##### Use

```{.bash}
dhrun run path/to/config.dhall 
dhrun run path/to/config.yaml
```

See file [quickstart.yml](./quickstart.yml) for an overview of `dhrun`'s
capabilities. The [resources](./resources) directory contains the Dhall types
for the configuration layer, and [examples](./examples/) directory contains
  other example `.yml` and `.dh` configurations.

The originally intended workflow is to configure dhrun using a dhall codebase.
In bash, this might involve a here document:

```{.bash}
dhrun run <<< "let codebase = /path/package.dhall in codebase.foo bar baz"
```

You can find an example project-specific configuration [here](https://xgitlab.cels.anl.gov/argo/argopkgs/blob/master/dhrun/all-tests.dh).

##### CLI Interface 

```{.hidden pipe="bash"}
echo "dhrun --help"
cd root
cabal build > /dev/null
```

```{.txt pipe="sh"}
root/dist/build/dhrun/dhrun --help
```

```{.bash}
dhrun run --help
```

```{.txt pipe="sh"}
root/dist/build/dhrun/dhrun run --help
```

##### Installation

- get [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/)

- run `nix-env -f https://github.com/freuk/dhrun.git -iA dhrun`

This pins nixpkgs 18.09. Building should take a minute or two and will
definitely succeed.

I have not tried building this code using stack or any other tool, but here are
the hackage dependencies for `dhrun` and its tests:

```{.unwrap pipe="runhaskell | pandoc -t json"}
{-# language OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# language NoImplicitPrelude #-}
import Protolude
import Distribution.PackageDescription.Parsec
import Distribution.PackageDescription
import Distribution.PackageDescription.Configuration
import Distribution.Verbosity
import Distribution.Types.Dependency
import Distribution.Types.PackageName
import Data.Text as T (pack)
main = do
  pdesc <- readGenericPackageDescription
             normal
             "root/dhrun.cabal"
  let depnames =
       map (unPackageName . depPkgName) $
       allBuildDepends $
       flattenPackageDescription pdesc
  for_ depnames $ \x -> putText $ "`" <> toS x <> "`"
```

##### Hacking

- `nix-shell` provides a dev environment with cabal-build, ghcid, hlint,
  brittany, and other tools. 

- you need to procure
  [`dhall-to-cabal`](https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-to-cabal) separately.
  It's necessary if you want to edit the cabal file, which is done through
  [`./cabal.dh`](./cabal.dh).

- edit `.README.md` instead of `README.md` and run `./shake readme`. `./shake`
  also has other useful dev workflows.

- `direnv allow` for [lorri](https://github.com/target/lorri) integration.

- use the `./pre-commit.sh` hook.

###### Structure

- `/nix` vendored nix expressions.

- `/resources` Dhall types and helper functions.

- `/app` the main cli tool.

- `/examples` example Dhall and YAML configuration files for dhrun. These
  also serve as golden tests.

- `/src` dhrun types and logic.

- `/tests` golden, unit, quickcheck tests.
