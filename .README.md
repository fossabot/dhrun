`dhrun`
=======

This is a Dhall/YAML configurable job executor meant to be used for pass/fail
CI tests. It starts a list of processes, monitors the standard streams for
patterns that should be expected or avoided, kills the processes when those
criteria are met and exits accordingly.

### Example configurations

See the [examples](./examples/) directory for example `.yml` and `.dh` configurations.

### Use

You can resolve imports, normalize, and run a dhall configuration on the fly with:

```{.bash}
dhrun run path/to/config.dhall 
```

You may also use a plain YAML file:
```{.bash}
dhrun run path/to/config.yaml
```

The the only notable command-line options are:

- `dhrun print` which prints the result of a dhall config to stdout
- the "-" file input argument which forces the binary to use the standard input
  (assuming the YAML format).
- the `-e` option which allows to edit the yaml configuration on the fly before
  execution

A workflow to evaluate the config via a dhall codebase at configuration time
might involve `dhall` and `dhall-to-yaml`:

```{.bash}
dhall resolve <<< "let codebase = /path/package.dhall in codebase.foo bar baz" |\
dhall normalize |\
dhall-to-yaml |\
dhrun run "-" 
```

### Installation

```
nix-env -f . -iA dhrun
```

### Dependencies

`dhrun` depends on:
```{.unwrap pipe="runhaskell | pandoc -t json"}
{-# language OverloadedStrings #-}
{-# language NoImplicitPrelude #-}
import Protolude
import Distribution.PackageDescription.Parsec
import Distribution.PackageDescription
import Distribution.PackageDescription.Configuration
import Distribution.Verbosity
import Distribution.Types.Dependency
import Distribution.Types.PackageName
import Data.Text as T (pack)
main = do
  pdesc <- readGenericPackageDescription
             normal
             "root/dhrun.cabal"
  let depnames =
       map (unPackageName . depPkgName) $
       allBuildDepends $
       flattenPackageDescription pdesc
  for_ depnames (putText .toS)
```

### Hacking

- `nix-shell` provides a dev environment with cabal-build, ghcid, hlint,
  brittany, and others. There is a small vendored codebase in /nix that
  provides this via nixpkgs pinning.  

The structure is the following.

- `/resources` Dhall types and helper functions.

- `/app` the main cli tool.

- `/examples`s example Dhall and YAML configuration files for dhrun. These
  also serve as golden tests.

- `/src` dhrun types and logic.

- `/tests` golden, unit, quickcheck tests.

### CLI Help

```{.hidden pipe="bash"}
echo "dhrun --help"
cd root
cabal build > /dev/null
```

```{.txt pipe="sh"}
root/dist/build/dhrun/dhrun --help
```
