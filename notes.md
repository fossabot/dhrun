- workdir creation

- add one more data layer for "augmented" types with newtypes that add type safety.

- CLI: dhall OR yaml, print yaml, verbosity cli override

- make sure error codes are checked properly, and 'cmd not found' cases fail properly

- add a timeout option.

- commands that exit properly and don't find 'wants' do not cause test failure!
